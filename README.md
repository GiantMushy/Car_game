## Naascar / Car_game
This was a largely personal project that started from a smaller school project in Computer Graphics course (Tölvugraffík first year). The code is messy and dissorganized, as this was done very early on in my programming career. 

### Learned lessons
- I learned a lot about the importance of code efficiency during this project, as I had to calculate and render the new screen hundreds of times per second, while keeping input responces fast and reliable.
- Files/classes and their relations were not well managed during this project. This caused big headaches when attempting to scale up the game. This was a valuable lesson for me, something I now always keep in mind when starting new projects.
- I didnt bother to keep an updated decision protocal, or any sort of documentation as this was a solo project. However, re-visting this only a year later, and I see its just a mess and I dont even know half of what I did. Another big lesson learned there, and something I have very much improved uppon in later projects.
